Two-Way Data Binding:
DoneDeal utilizes two-way data binding to establish a connection between user input fields (such as forms) and the underlying data model.
When users make changes to their profiles or settings, the changes are immediately reflected in the UI and persisted to the backend.
Dynamic Content Rendering:
Data binding dynamically renders content on the frontend based on the state of the application and user interactions.
For example, when a user searches for a car model, the search results are dynamically updated in real-time as the user types.
